# Cocktails
The goal of this coding exercise is to create a Sample React App using the Cocktails API

[https://www.thecocktaildb.com/](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)

## The task is:

Create a React App that allows a user to type in a substring of 2 or more characters and search on a Cocktail by name

- The search box should be interactive so it changes the contents of the page as the user types.
- The results of the search should display below the search box.
- The search results should include a tabular list of cocktails. Include whatever relevant details you would like about each cocktail (description, thumbnail, etc.).
- Allow the user to click on each one of the cocktails to see more detail about it on an additional (bookmarkable) page.
- That page should include more detail about the cocktail as well as its ingredients

The relevant APIs are:
Search cocktail by name
www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita

Lookup full cocktail details by id
www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=11007

## Output

The end product should be a runnable React app that can be a github repository or a zip file.

However you would like to get that file to us is fine, as long as we can run it.

Please include details how to bootstrap and run the app in your Github README.

Please also include design decisions, trade-offs, or things that you would have done had you had more time.

Feel free to use whatever UI frameworks you would like to assist you.
Also, to create the app, [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is very useful as a starting point.

The goal is for this exercise to take no more than 4 hours.
Please feel free to email with any questions you may have.
